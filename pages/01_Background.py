    \n
    I have been working lately (Feb 2026 at time of this writing) on search systems and 
    RAG architecture for enterprise level software.  I wanted to gain additional experience
    in developing these systems, so I created this project.  This takes in a detailed account
    of my professional, personal, and academic experiences (although what I have in the database
    now is far from complete) and puts it in a place that is searchable through natural language.
    \n
    Feel free to search around and see what results appear.  If you have any recommendations,
    questions, or want to chat, please email me at reedyt22@gmail.com or message me
